Whatever issues you had initially setting it up should not persist on powering it down. First step is to determine if it is the Evergreen Hub or the drive making noise, both have a fan.

Surely I would have been better to have just received the \\u00a325 voucher in the set, and bought a large bottle, as a large bottle would have cost \\u00a370 in this case.\\nI am honestly a little bit miffed; you can advertise this as a good deal, which it obviously isn\\u2019t when you remove the \\u00a325 voucher from the Discovery set.

The set costs \\u00a329 plus \\u00a370 for a total of \\u00a399.  By purchasing the set after upgrading your voucher for \\u00a388 (<DATE_TIME>) you save \\u00a311 on the purchase of a full-size bottle.

Then I was told the shipping had changed so now I see that they are wanting to charge me $20 for shipping as well.\n\nI did want the order but think $20 shipping is a bit excessive. Anyway, if you can approve the order for the $72.70 total,\u00a0that would be great and I would like to place the order.\nIf not I guess I'll wait or go back to crest white strips.\n\nThanks for your\u00a0help.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes and happy holidays.\n<PERSON>\n<PHONE_NUMBER>\nCustomer's Message: YOU'VE GOT VOICEMAIL!\n\nHello!

Romero\\n\\nai_message: Hey there,\\nApple recently released <DATE_TIME>, bringing unexpected updates that have temporarily hindered our customers from replying to texts. However, it is important to note that even with this setback, text notifications will still be delivered to your watch and can be accessed. Furthermore, we would like to inform you that based on a recent update on Android, a similar limitation applies: users currently cannot send or reply to texts directly from their watches. We understand the inconvenience this may cause for both Apple and Android users and want to assure you that we are actively working on restoring this functionality as soon as possible. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated.\\n\\nhuman_message: Megan Hunter,\\n\\nI understand that that as I have an android watch, but what I'm asking is the abilities are similar to what I am currently using with the exception of wireless charging which doesn't bother me. What I am after is a smart watch that can and will hold up to all elements that affect the product. As I said I am a chef in a kitchen that sticks their hand in a 500 degree oven, does inventory in a freezer, gets hands and arms banged/burnt, works over a hot grill, fry, hand smacks table, pots, etc.... If you believe this watch can take that beating, as I said my current watch I have had for <DATE_TIME> and the LCD screen has a small bleed now, while it's predecessor <US_DRIVER_LICENSE> lasted <DATE_TIME> it finally died. I need a good stable watch that I can receive text and respond back to without pulling out my phone. I need a watch that I can answer a phone call from emergency calls (family), vendors I work with, etc... Without pulling out my phone to use, I will buy it. I will also give you my input as to how well it handled in a kitchen with so many obstacles. I do not like apple products, I wanted to get that out there. I have tried alpha delta and didn't like it, I tried carbionx and did not like that watch either. They allowed you to get the notification but you have to pull out your phone to reply. I am a big believer of good quality products and do my best as a consumer to give praise for such products. I hope this gives you a better understanding of what I am trying to ask with what your product can provide. Also I am not looking to have a watch as a phone but as a Bluetooth extension of my phone, if that makes sense.\\n\\nai_message: Hi there, \\nThanks for clarifying. Yes, our watches are durable. We also have a <DATE_TIME> Guarantee, with that, you can have you replaced if there are some issues with it. Also, you can make and receive phone calls from the watch.

If you have acidic skin this can cause them to tarnish faster. Things such as lotions, perfumes or even soap and water can cause vermeil to tarnish as well.\nI recommend lightly polishing your Gold Vermeil pieces after wear to avoid <IN_PAN>.

Please reply to this email to confirm, and we'll take care of the rest.\nBest regards,\n<PERSON>\nAudien Support\nCustomer's Message: You know when I first got my Atom hearing aids, I was flooded with <LOCATION> emails, phone calls offering help.\u00a0 I wrote the other day saying I needed help fixing one of the aids and to <DATE_TIME> I have not heard one peep from <LOCATION>.\n\nI've had two emails saying they can't find my order when I provided the information in the very beginning to you.\u00a0 I purchased them thru Amazon because they were the same price, the same aids, and could be delivered to me <DATE_TIME> as compared to your website that said it would be <DATE_TIME> before shipping to me.\n\nI am ready to throw these in the trash.\u00a0 I have replaced the origianal wax plugs, had to order a kit with a new supply in them along with the ear domes and another tool kit.\u00a0 Only thing I got that I didn't have already was the plastic box.\u00a0 I <IN_PAN> I have to reorder a kit to get more wax plugs in the future.\u00a0 Along with that will come more ear domes which are not needed.\u00a0 Point is I'm paying for things I don't need.\n\nI should be able to order a quantity of wax plugs alone.\u00a0 The ear domes need to be <IN_PAN> as to which pkg is small, medium or large.\u00a0 They all look the same to me.\u00a0 I only need the one size I settle on when I need to reorder them.\u00a0 Probably won't because the hearing aids are either going to be returned to Amazon, or thrown in the trash can.\u00a0 I'll just turn the TV volume back up to 40 and my wife can get some ear plugs or muffs.\n\n<PERSON><PERSON>\nCustomer's Message: Well don't know how many times I've already done this but here it is again.\u00a0 I ordered thru Amazon because I could get them <DATE_TIME> (my B-day) instead of waiting <DATE_TIME> thru your website.\u00a0 Same for the toolkit I received.\n\nEmail is this one <EMAIL_ADDRESS>; order # is\u00a0ORDER #\u00a0113-<CREDIT_CARD> an Amazon order number/; First name is <PERSON>, Last is <PERSON>;\u00a0 \u00a0phone number is <UK_NHS> my cell\u00a0 or the landline <DATE_TIME> but that is set to forward to my cell so I get all the scammer calls.\u00a0 This also has been verified to have lifetime warranty and I could probably find that email <IN_PAN> such if you can't.\n\nJust tell me how to fix this one unit.\u00a0 It still just gives the rushing wind noise and cleaning the front, replacing the wax plugs has not helped restore it.\n\nThanks whomever you are.\u00a0 I've been contacted and responded to <PERSON>, <PERSON>, and a host of other employees at <LOCATION>.\u00a0 I'm not a big fan yet of these, they are kind of a pain in the butt but before you tell me I'm inserting them in the wrong place, I'll let you know I have that correct.\n\n<PERSON> Message: Hi ,\nI wasn't able to locate your order with your email, <EMAIL_ADDRESS>.

That does\u2019t exactly fit into the warranty & guarantees tab you have under all the specs of the product.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed this company deletes any reviews under 5 stars off their company website and won\u2019t show anything under. And your Facebook doesn\u2019t allow people to review. You\u2019re conducting shady, unprofessional business. I\u2019ve also noticed people sharing to their own Facebook how you guys refuse returns.\nAgent's Message: Hello <LOCATION>,\nAllow me to clarify some points.\nWe do not need a photo of your foot. We need anything proving that you were burned because of our product. Those are 2 different things.\nIt was very clear in my previous message that you also have the option to just send a video detailing the issue of the sauna, because it is what we are interested in. We are not interested in any part of your body.\nSince you are already on our website, you may want to check on this too -\n<URL>\nThis is exactly why I was asking you for a photo or a video proof - so I can help you further.\nYour sauna has obviously been used and if you don't have anything to show us that there is something wrong with it then it is not qualified to be returned.\nThe steam pools in the base of my sauna and leaks and makes my floor soaking wet. -\nplease send us a video showing this exact issue so we can move forward.\nCustomer's Message: \u201cEasy returns\u201d\nCustomer's Message: Hi there,\nYou can NOT be serious that you are really asking for a photo of my foot? That\u2019s some customer service!! I am actually mind blown right now.\nI can send a video of my sauna <DATE_TIME> but I will NOT be sending you a photo of my foot.\n\nPlease get me in contact with someone higher up in position.\nI will be returning my sauna and I want my money back from dissatisfaction with the product.\n\nAs stated on your website,\n\n\u201c<DATE_TIME> money back guarantee\u201d\n\u201cIf you are unhappy with your order, we\u2019ll help you with the return and refund you.\u201d\nAgent's Message: Hello <LOCATION>,\nWould you be able to send us any photo to document the issue? A photo of the burn on your foot, etc? Or any video showing the issue so we can have this escalated.\nCustomer's Message: Please let me know how I start the process to return. Thanks.\nCustomer's Message: I\u2019m sad to say the least, I wanted to absolutely love it. But now I rarely use it since I got it.\n\nThe steam pools in the base of my sauna and leaks and makes my floor soaking wet.\nI have now been burnt twice now from the steam on my foot & toe.\n\nThank you\nAgent's Message: We are sorry to hear about your dissatisfaction, <LOCATION>!\n<DATE_TIME> we know what the problem is?\nCustomer's Message: Hi there\nI\u2019m looking to find the return option on the website but am having no luck.

I received my order <DATE_TIME> and am a bit disappointed. I ordered your lightweight interfacing as I knew for sure I needed light. I have never ordered <PERSON> interfacing before so I wanted the sample pack as well. I need medium or heavy but wasn't sure which one suited my needs. When I tried to add the sample pack to my order it took my shipping from $4.44 to like $16. I called an spoke to someone and they said to add a note to add the sample. When I put in my order it did not have a spot for a note so I put in my order in and called your staff member back and they said they would let shipping know to add the sample. I received my package <DATE_TIME> and there is no sample. This sucks as I do need interfacing either medium or heavy and dont know which one to order from you. Also not a huge deal but I had 2 antique brass snaps in my cart when I reviewed my order and once I put in my order there was only 1. So I dont know if there was an issue with your site but thought you might want to know. I'd put in another order for those 2 items but I dont want to pay for shipping again.\n\nThank you,\n\n<PERSON>\n\n****************************************\nFrom:\nEmmaline Bags Inc.\nSent:\n<DATE_TIME>, 2023 <DATE_TIME>\nTo:\n<EMAIL_ADDRESS>\nSubject:\nMessage from Emmaline Bags Inc.\nHELLOADRIANE,\n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CALLING INTO THE STORE TODAY, ANGIE!\nOUR STAFF WERE THRILLED TO HEAR THAT YOU WERE SO PLEASED AND\nIT REALLY WAS NICE FOR THEM ALL TO SHARE THE MESSAGE.

        "sources": "[[\"human_message: What if my order is <PERSON>: In my order No. 23409, I ordered both the light and medium EB-Fuse.  I am thinking I got the heavy EB-Fuse instead of the medium. It is very stiff. I looked at the video on your website again and checked for the \\\"glue dots\\\" on the back of the interfacing.  The light had the dots on the back but the other interfacing did not have dots but a coating on it.  Even though the sticker on the interfacing says medium I think I may have received the heavy instead. I have used some of the, what I thought was medium, on some cotton and vinyl thinking it would give more body. However, when I was done, it is very crinkly and I began to doubt the thickness of the interfacing.  That is when I went on your website to check the video.  I can send you a sample of the interfacing I got if you would like.  Let me know what I should do.  I don't think I would be using the heavy for very many of my projects so I could send back what I have in exchange for the medium.\\n\\nhuman_message: Sorry, the order number is <US_DRIVER_LICENSE>\\n\\nai_message: Hello <PERSON>, I am sorry to hear we may have messed that up! Can you please send me close up photos of the two of them next to each other, front and back. As well as let me know if there is a colour ink on selvedge edges. It will have a few dots of colour here and there. If so, what colour is it?   It will be helpful to see the closeup photos of them next to each other for sure.  \\nAs well, I should let you know that there is only a very slight difference between the the medium and the heavy interfacing. If there are wrinkles, it is cotton so you will be able to press it out, but it will take more heat. \\nI will watch for the photos. You can please send them to <EMAIL_ADDRESS> \\nThank you! \\nJanelle\\n\\nhuman_message: ok will do shortly\"]]"

Please advise.\\n\\nThanks \\nDB\\n\\nai_message: Hi <PERSON>! \\nThanks for reaching out! \\nI am unable to see your cart, so I am not sure exactly which items you have added.    Our prices had to have a slight increase <DATE_TIME> due to cost of business <IN_PAN>, but only by a few cents, and only on a few items - we wanted to keep it a low impact to our customers. \\nI am thinking the wrist strap, depending on which one you have in your cart is contributing to the total.    I am sorry if the total of your cart will not work for you, we do try our best to keep <IN_PAN>.\\n\\nai_message: Hi <PERSON>, <PERSON> here! \\nI just want to add, <PERSON>, that if you are getting bumped up to parcel rates, the minimum parcel rate to <LOCATION> from <LOCATION> has increased a lot due to fuel <IN_PAN> put on by Canada Post. There has been an increase in shipping that is not added by us. Our shipping rates come direct from our website <IN_PAN> to the Canada Post site, and we do get a <IN_PAN> discount that is passed on to you. \\nI know it is hard, it had been difficult for our business to deal with the increased shipping costs as it hurts our sales and upsets our long time customers. Just so you know, you can get a lot in those parcels. The way they rate it is that it is for 300 grams and up, it's not less for small parcels. A lot of our customers are trying to save on shipping during these high fuel <IN_PAN> by filling up the package. So if you add items until the shipping pops up to the next rate, and then take something out until it goes back down, you will have maxed out your shipping.   Sometimes our customers will get 2 or 3 letters instead of parcel! That is much cheaper. Unfortunately, the handle you wanted to order cannot go by letter as the limit is 2 cm thick. \\nI hope that helps.  We don't like to think that you may wondering if we are overcharging. I hope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions. \\nJanelle MacKay\\n\\nhuman_message: Hi Janelle,\\n\\nI know Canada Post have increased their rates. \\u00a0I tried breaking things down so they could ship cheaper\\<URL>ybe I\\u2019ll give it another try and see if I can justify the purchases.\\n\\nThanks for trying to help.

We are in constant conversation with Canada Post, and will continue to push them to lower their rates.  It is not fair that is so expensive to ship in our own country. \\nThere are a few quilt shops in <LOCATION> that carry our products, hopefully if all else fails you may be able to find some <PERSON> hardware locally.\\n\\nhuman_message: Hi <PERSON> some reason when I went back to recheck my cart, the shipping reduced to $4.44! <PERSON>!! \\u00a0I\\u2019m going ahead with <PERSON> very happy to do. \\u00a0Love dealing with you guys.\\n\\nDeb\"], [\"human_message: Have any other questions?\\n\\nhuman_message: Hi.  I have an order in my cart and shipping at $20 seems excessive for domestic shipping.   What happened to the cheaper one?   Last order, <DATE_TIME>, shipping was around $3.50 or close to that.   This option did not come up this time..   Is it no longer available?\\n\\nai_message: Hello <PERSON>, <PERSON> is still there, but is only offered if the cart is light enough in weight. There is a weight limit on Oversize letter and they can't be thicker than 2 cm. Try taking some items out of cart and splitting it into 2 letters instead of one parcel. \\nUnfortunately, Canada Post rates are high right now for parcels and we get a 40% discount. Our rates are connected to Canada Post in checkout so those are rates direct from them with our CP account! \\nI hope that helps!\\nJanelle\\n\\nai_message: In addition to my other email, I see in your abandoned checkout that you have a zipper in the cart. The zippers automatically cancel out the letter option because they can't be shipped under 2 cm by the time they are folded up. Sadly, if you are to order zippers you need parcel. You can get quite a lot in a parcel, actually, so if you order a few zippers, fabric etc, and maybe more hardware to last a bit longer, the shipping can be more cost effective. I am not trying to upsell you, but just let you know what our other customers are doing, since shipping is so high right now.\\n\\nhuman_message: Thank you for explaining this to me.\\u00a0\\u00a0 I removed the zipper and the shipping went down.\\u00a0\\u00a0 I will place another order later, which will include the zipper and some other things.\\u00a0\\u00a0 I will have to make list of what I will need.\\n\\nThank you for your patience.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Joan\\n\\nSent from  Mail  for Windows\\n\\nai_message: Happy to help, <PERSON>!

The undated format will give you\\nmore flexibility (if you miss a day\\u2014or a week\\u2014just adjust\\nyour planner and try again!), make the planner easier to use\\n(cleaning up some of the content and layouts will declutter\\nyour <IN_PAN> of The <IN_PAN>), and provide more amazing\\<IN_PAN> (since we can put some of it online for easy\\<IN_PAN>).\\n\\<URL>d yes, we'll design it so you still have easy access to\\nthe <IN_PAN> calendar and key devotions!\\n\\nSECONDLY, we are looking for investors and advisors. One of\\nour goals is to raise the capital we need to buy our\\nproducts far in advance and to be able to ship immediately.\\nWhich means that soon\\u2014God <LOCATION> be able to order\\nyour <IN_PAN> and receive it right away, or at least,\\nyou'll receive it <DATE_TIME> in advance of the seasonal\\nstart date.\\n\\nBut that doesn't help you NOW, so here's what we're going to\\ndo to make this up to you:\\n\\nWe will provide compensation at a rate of $.60 per day +\\n$1.00 per week.

I am getting a crackle sound similar to a blown speaker. Then it shuts off. I think it was caused by a loud alarm that went off near where I was standing. The other one seems to be working fine.

Our shipping rates come direct from our website <IN_PAN> to the Canada Post site, and we do get a <IN_PAN> discount that is passed on to you. \\nI know it is hard, it had been difficult for our business to deal with the increased shipping costs as it hurts our sales and upsets our long time customers.

A lot of our customers are trying to save on shipping during these high fuel <IN_PAN> by filling up the package. So if you add items until the shipping pops up to the next rate, and then take something out until it goes back down, you will have maxed out your shipping.

Thank you.\nAgent's Message: <PERSON>,\nThank you for your reply.\nUnfortunately, the order has already shipped so we are unable to edit it. The USPS tracking information is as follows:\n9434609109005503418889\n9434609109005002096847\nThese tracking numbers are still new so USPS has not provided an update or projected delivery date.\nWe have issued a refund for the Tecolote White Ranunculus bulbs as a courtesy since we weren't able to stop the order to edit it. The refund is in the amount of $13.38. You should seed those funds on your end within the next 2-3 business days. You may be able to store the bulbs a little longer and then start them indoors in <DATE_TIME>.\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out again if we can be helpful.\nHappy gardening!\nShawnee\nCustomer's Message: Can i drop the ranunculus from the order then.\nAgent's Message: <PERSON>,\nThank you for your recent order. We appreciate your business!\nWe hope you'll be happy to know that all the tulip, daffodil, and allium bulbs in your order are cold hardy perennials in your area. They will return <DATE_TIME> after <DATE_TIME>! However, the Persian Buttercups (\nRanunculus asiaticus\n) bulbs are not cold hardy in <NRP> planting zone 5. In cooler zones 1-7, they must be started indoors and can be moved outdoors in <DATE_TIME>. Here's how to care for them:\nPlant the Ranunculus a sunny location in well-drained soil. Ranunculus loves moisture during the growing period and drier conditions as <DATE_TIME> progresses \u2013 so a spot with good drainage is a must. After the growing season ends, lift the tubers and store them in a cool, dry, dark place over <DATE_TIME>, replanting them in <DATE_TIME> after all danger of frost has passed.\nWe hope this information is helpful and your spring is awash in colorful blooms! Please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if we can be helpful.\nHappy gardening!\n<PERSON> Message: Are the bulbs perennials?\nAgent's Message: <PERSON>,\nThank you for contacting <NRP> Meadows.\nIn <DATE_TIME>, the bulbs need to develop a root system before the ground freezes when the ground temperatures reach around 40\u00b0 - 50\u00b0F.  These temps will signal the bulbs to grow roots, but not sprout. According to your frost dates, you usually get your first frost anywhere from <DATE_TIME>. You can also check your\nfrost dates\nhere. It looks like your current soil temperatures are in <DATE_TIME>. You can check your\nsoil temperatures\nhere as well.\nThese tools can help you navigate when to plant in your region.\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out again if we can be of any assistance. We\u2019re always happy to help!\nHappy gardening!\nCustomer's Message: Hi,\n\nI just ordered and didn\u2019t think to look if the bulbs are perennial or <DATE_TIME>.

Thank you for your order.  Since we not working <DATE_TIME>, and we'd like to have your orders ready to ship when we are back to work, it's best for us if you place a second order now.

The zippers are not set to automatically ship as a Letter, since they have to be folded up tight for them to squish down to 2cm that is the letter requirement by Canada Post.  \\nIt doesn't matter if it is 1 or 5, we have them set to not ship by letter mail. Since it is only one though, I will ask our staff to flatten it the best they can and get that in a letter and refund the difference.

Please respond\n\n<PERSON>\n\n<PERSON>\nCustomer's Message: Im not <IN_PAN> in trying the smaller ones. I'm going to a local hearing <IN_PAN>. Apologize for taking so long to ok reply. Came down with Covid. Sick for most of <DATE_TIME>. <IN_PAN> your effort in trying to help but they aren't for me. Would like to return them.\nAgent's Message: Hello,\nIf you have tried <IN_PAN> and nothing is working for you, don't worry, we will take care of you. We would like to offer you an upgrade to our best model, Atom PRO, at the <IN_PAN> cost of only $60. It is 22% smaller than the Atom and has enhanced feedback cancellation as well as improved sound <IN_PAN> making the sound more crisp and clear.\u00a0The charging case is also portable. If you allow the case to charge <DATE_TIME>, it will store the charge for about 3-4 days.\nAre you <IN_PAN>?\nCustomer's Message: Taking the cups off made them more painful to wear. Unfortunately they have not stayed in my ear with the cups on and without them they are painful. Sound quality is not EQ'd as well as I had hoped. What other solutions do you have?\nAgent's Message: Hi ,\nIf none of the earbud sizes work for you and the hearing aids are too large, you may try them without the earbuds. When doing this, please make sure to clean the hearing aids and replace the wax guards more regularly. Although the earbud makes the hearing aid more comfortable, it is not necessary for the hearing aids to function properly.\nCustomer's Message: Thanks for the tips but what is happening is they don\u2019t seat well in my ears and when I\u2019m greeting someone with a hug they start to feedback which is embarrassing. I might have small ear canals that cause the hearing aids to slip out. Do you have a different ear cup?\nAgent's Message: If you are experiencing feedback/whistling from your hearing aids, don't worry, this is a normal <IN_PAN> when inserting them. I suggest you gently press the hearing aid deeper into your ear canal until this feedback stops. The <IN_PAN> is the cause of this sound, and once you have adjusted the hearing aid to the correct position, it should go away!\nAlso,\n1) Feedback upon insertion is expected. It's normal to occur with in-ear devices. The main thing is that the feedback should only happen when getting the device inserted, and once it's inserted properly, there should be minimal to zero feedback.\n2) Volume will affect feedback during insertion. Set the volume to level 1 before inserting to avoid it <IN_PAN>. Just hold the units close to your ears, click the buttons to set volume to live 1, and then insert them.\n3) It's hard to avoid touching the <IN_PAN> when grabbing the device, and the closer your hand is to the mic, the more likely it is to cause feedback. So the best way to insert the device is by holding it by the pull wire, which is the farthest point away from the unit. Hold the unit by the pull wire, and let your fingers gently support the unit from the back, which is also the complete opposite side of the mic.\nCustomer's Message: Hello, I've not had good success with the in ear. I get so much feedback and they fall out of my ears. I would like to return them.\nAgent's Message: Hi,\nThanks for reaching out.\nYou can order it from here\n<URL>\nor call us from <DATE_TIME> at <PHONE_NUMBER>.\nPlease let us know if there's anything else needed.\nBest,\nCustomer's Message: Ok that worked. I would like to order more\nAgent's Message: Ok, understood, please follow the steps in this video for replacing your wax guards and let me know the results, be sure to turn the volume on the hearing aids to the highest setting before starting:\nLooking forward to your response,\nCustomer's Message: I would like to return the Atom hearings aids. One if them went dead and contacted support. No reply so please send an rma asap so I can get this resolved.\n\nThanks\n\n<PERSON>\nCustomer's Message: One of the hearing aids is dead.
